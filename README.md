# Sample theme for Drupal 8
**riancallahan_com_neato** is a subtheme of the [Neato](https://www.drupal.org/project/neato) theme for Drupal 8. Neato is based on the [Bourbon Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/) responsive grid framework. This subtheme uses media queries, preprocess functions, and Gulp + Bower + NPM.

All SASS code is organized using a SMACSS approach. Modified Twig templates are used to simplify both HTML structure and default class-naming logic. Extra fields have been added to the theme's Settings page for use in twig templates.
